                            Worked as a consultant attending to the needs of medium scale companies looking for expertise when starting a new data warehouse or large companies looking to migrate an existing data warehouse to a cloud provider. The medium scale contracts were done by me individually, where I would work with the client daily and regularly report to a contract manager with my company. The larger contracts were led formally by a data architect who dictated the pacing of sprints among a few data engineers.

The initial tasks were automating any existing Excel, SAS, or SQL procedure as much as possible and ad-hoc reporting for contact center leaders looking for answers not found in existing BI reports. Towards the latter half of my time here I was engineering data marts for more focused analysis from regional managers or managers wanting to see customer journeys contacting the bank through all possible mediums.

                            For one year I was trained in basic digital and analog circuits, radio telecommunication, and radar, followed by one year of machine specific training on the LINK system made to share radar telemetry between network participants. The remaining four years I was assigned to the USS Ford, a new class of aircraft carrier that was still in construction when arriving. Before being seaworthy I installed small Windows networks hooked up to unclassified DoD IP networks. My final year I supervised the work center that contained my LINK equipment. I monitored and inspected the maintenance performed by my colleagues and withstood grueling inspection of the paper and digital reports.

Using NLP libraries available in Python, topics were modeled based on word correlations and audience demands.

                            Fred was part of a data science team that performed a high-level analysisâ€”both quantitative and qualitativeâ€”of data critical to my company. The analysis was immensely helpful. Also, I was pleasantly surprised at how the data science team was able break a highly complex analysis into small pieces intelligible to a general audience. I highly recommend Fred to future employers.

                            Fred has been a fantastic peer and contributor to get to know. He is self motivated, dedicated to quality, tenacious, and always wanting to learn more.
